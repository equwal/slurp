* Description
To slurp is the quest of many an Emacser. While vim has the =:r= and =:r!=,
emacs has other slurping tools, allowing for prepending, appending, inserting, and copying =buffers= too!

* Key bindings

=SPC i[nsert] b[uffer]= is the intended mnemonic.

| Key Binding | Description                             |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------|
| ~SPC i b <~ | prepend-to-buffer                       |
| ~SPC i b >~ | append-to-buffer                        |
| ~SPC i b i~ | insert-[another buffer into this]buffer |
| ~SPC i b c~ | copy-buffer                             |
| ~SPC i b f~ | amend-to-file                           |
